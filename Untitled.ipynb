Later, \\nthe availability of the internet facilitated \\nthe construction \\nof Virtual Learning Environments \\n(VLEs) that have been \\ndeveloped to facilitate interaction and collaboration \\n(Schwienhorst, 2002)\\n.\\n \\nVLEs have been incorporated into many higher education institutions. Regarding the field of \\nlearning \\nEnglish as a Foreign Language\\n \\n(EFL), there has been a clear preference for \\ncomb\\nining \\nVirtual Language Learning Environments (VLLEs) \\nand flipped learning approaches\\n \\nover \\ntraditional in\\n-\\nclass learning. VLLEs appear in various forms, such as platforms, games and social \\nnetworks \\n(Mroz, 2014)\\n. This preference for utilising VLLEs is due to\\n \\na number of reasons. First, \\nmany EFL studies have revealed the positive impact that VLLEs bring to language learners in \\nterms of learning development despite the existing challenges (e.g., training, cost and security \\nissues) \\n(Mroz, 2014)\\n\\nthat VLLEs provide a space for collaborative learning \\n(Mroz, 2014)\\n. Collaborative learning is a \\n\\n(Miyake \\n&\\n \\nKirschner, 2014, \\np. 420\\n)\\n. This \\nprocess requires \\nthat learners work together when solving problems or completing tasks. Additionally, many \\nlinguists believe that VLLEs can create a learning environment that resembles the culture of the \\ntarget language, \\nand consequently, this can further \\nfacilitate language learning \\n(Mroz, 2014)\\n. Also, \\nthe incorporation of VLEs, which entails the use of technology, \\n\\nneeds of digital \\nlearners\\n\\n \\n(Gamble, 2018\\n, p.  \\n23)\\n.  VLLEs is not obstacle\\n-\\nfree. \\nThe purpose of this study is to \\ninvestigate the perc\\neptions of Saudi university students towards online learning during the \\nCOVID\\n-\\n19 quarantine period. This work presents one of so many stories around the world \\nregarding education in the time of COVID\\n-\\n19. There are some expectations across the world that \\nCO\\nVID\\n-\\n19 will persist for months and will continue to affect the next academic semester. Many \\nuniversities around the world have made their decisions to continue with online lectures for the \\ncoming academic year. It is hoped that this study will allow educat\\nional authorities and instructors \\nto get a sense of how learners experience online learning in order to improve the delivery of online \\n\\ncan be an effective sou\\nrce for informing the design and content of professional development \\ncourses for language instructors, more particularly when teaching in a time of unease. The focus \\non using Blackboard (hereafter BB) in this study has emerged from the fact that it is a co\\nmmon \\nteaching and learning platform at many Saudi universities and at many international universities. \\nAccordingly, this study answers the following question: \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\nThis main questi\\non is divided into the following sub\\n-\\nquestions:\\n \\na)\\n \\nWhat are the benefits of BB learning as perceived by learners?\\n \\nb)\\n \\nWhat are the problems with BB learning as perceived by learners?  \\n \\n \\nLiterature Review\\n \\nVLLEs: \\nMerits\\n \\nand \\nBarriers\\n \\nThere are two delivery modes of online courses: Asynchronous and synchronous. \\nAn \\nasynchronous mode of learning refers to the delivery of learning resources and materials via \\n\\nline \\ncommunication does not require the real\\n-\\ntime participation of instructor and students, which can \\n'"
