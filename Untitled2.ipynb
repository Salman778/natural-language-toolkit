Later, \\n\\nthe availability of the internet facilitated the construction of Virtual Learning Environments \\n\\n(VLEs) that have been developed to facilitate interaction and collaboration (Schwienhorst, 2002). \\n\\nVLEs have been incorporated into many higher education institutions. Regarding the field of \\n\\nlearning English as a Foreign Language (EFL), there has been a clear preference for combining \\n\\nVirtual Language Learning Environments (VLLEs) and flipped learning approaches over \\n\\ntraditional in-class learning. VLLEs appear in various forms, such as platforms, games and social \\n\\nnetworks (Mroz, 2014). This preference for utilising VLLEs is due to a number of reasons. First, \\n\\nmany EFL studies have revealed the positive impact that VLLEs bring to language learners in \\n\\nterms of learning development despite the existing challenges (e.g., training, cost and security \\n\\nissues) (Mroz, 2014). What facilitates the development of the learners’ language skills is the fact \\n\\nthat VLLEs provide a space for collaborative learning (Mroz, 2014). Collaborative learning is a \\n\\n“social process of knowledge building” (Miyake & Kirschner, 2014, p. 420). This process requires \\n\\nthat learners work together when solving problems or completing tasks. Additionally, many \\n\\nlinguists believe that VLLEs can create a learning environment that resembles the culture of the \\n\\ntarget language, and consequently, this can further facilitate language learning (Mroz, 2014). Also, \\n\\nthe incorporation of VLEs, which entails the use of technology, meets “the needs of digital \\n\\nlearners” (Gamble, 2018, p.  23).  VLLEs is not obstacle-free. The purpose of this study is to \\n\\ninvestigate the perceptions of Saudi university students towards online learning during the \\n\\nCOVID-19 quarantine period. This work presents one of so many stories around the world \\n\\nregarding education in the time of COVID-19. There are some expectations across the world that \\n\\nCOVID-19 will persist for months and will continue to affect the next academic semester. Many \\n\\nuniversities around the world have made their decisions to continue with online lectures for the \\n\\ncoming academic year. It is hoped that this study will allow educational authorities and instructors \\n\\nto get a sense of how learners experience online learning in order to improve the delivery of online \\n\\ncourses and advance teaching innovation in their contexts. Also, learners’ experiences with VLLEs \\n\\ncan be an effective source for informing the design and content of professional development \\n\\ncourses for language instructors, more particularly when teaching in a time of unease. The focus \\n\\non using Blackboard (hereafter BB) in this study has emerged from the fact that it is a common \\n\\nteaching and learning platform at many Saudi universities and at many international universities. \\n\\nAccordingly, this study answers the following question:   \\n\\n \\n\\nWhat are the students’ perceptions towards learning via BB during quarantine? \\n\\nThis main question is divided into the following sub-questions: \\n\\na) What are the benefits of BB learning as perceived by learners? \\nb) What are the problems with BB learning as perceived by learners?   \\n\\n \\n\\nLiterature Review \\n\\nVLLEs: Merits and Barriers \\n\\nThere are two delivery modes of online courses: Asynchronous and synchronous. An \\n\\nasynchronous mode of learning refers to the delivery of learning resources and materials via \\n\\nLearning Management System platforms (LMS), such as BB or Moodle. “Asynchronous online \\n\\ncommunication does not require the real-time participation of instructor and students, which can \\n\\n6 \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nbe supported through tools such as e-mails, discussion boards, blogs, wikis, or video/audio \\n\\nrecordings” (Huang & Hsiao, 2012, p.15).  This mode allows students to study at their own pace \\n\\n(Reese, 2014). Synchronous mode involves the real-time delivery of course contents. Synchronous \\n\\nsoftware allow “students and instructors to communicate orally, exchange messages through \\n\\ntyping, upload PowerPoint presentations, transmit video, [or] surf websites together” (Mc Brien, \\n\\nJones & Cheng, 2009, p. 2).  It has been claimed that “Synchronous e-learning, commonly \\n\\nsupported by media such as videoconferencing and chat, has the potential to support e-learners in \\n\\nthe development of learning communities.” (Hrastinski, 2008, p.52). It offers whiteboard, video \\n\\nand audio streaming and sharing files (Cornelius, 2014; Rudd & Rudd, 2014). The non-verbal \\n\\ncommunication signals accompanying the synchronous conferencing sessions make learners feel \\n\\nmore connected and engaged with their peers and instructors (Rudd & Rudd, 2014). This helps to \\n\\novercome the students’ feeling of isolation occurs in asynchronous environments (Tunceren, Kaur, \\n\\nMullins & Slimp, 2015). However, technical problems, such as the internet speed, might stand as \\n\\na barrier to students’ engagement with synchronous platforms (Rudd & Rudd, 2014). Although it \\n\\nmight seem that asynchronous tools are less communicative than the synchronous tools, some \\n\\nstudies claim that asynchronous tools can improve learners’ cognitive skills (e.g., Ogbonna, Ibezim \\n\\n& Obi, 2019).           \\n\\n             \\n\\n  In the field of higher education, there are several multidisciplinary studies that have \\n\\nexamined the merits and challenges of VLEs platforms and modes of learning in different contexts, \\n\\nand various (sometimes contradictory) results have been obtained; ultimately, this keeps the debate \\n\\non limiting or expanding VLEs in higher education very much alive.  For instance, many studies \\n\\nhave investigated the merits and challenges of using BB, which is the focus of this study. Some \\n\\nstudies found that university students value the communicative aspect of BB that leads to active \\n\\nand equal participation opportunities in asynchronous environments (e.g., Huang & Hsiao, 2012). \\n\\nIn contrary, other studies found that students believed that the asynchronous mode of BB does not \\n\\nprovide them with a space for active learning because of the lack of direct communication with \\n\\npeers and instructors and the time needed for participation, so the ignorance of answering others’ \\n\\nquestion was obvious. These students also believed that BB sessions should be used as a \\n\\ncomplementary tool to in-class teaching (e.g., Vonderwell, 2003; Wilson & Whitlock, 1998). \\n\\nSome studies revealed that the synchronous mode is valued as an interactional tool by learners \\n\\n(e.g., Chen, Dobinson & Kent, 2020; Guo, 2013), but not by staff (e.g., Heirdsfield, Walker, \\n\\nTambyah & Beutel, 2011).        \\n\\n  \\n\\n  Regarding the field of ELF, some studies have found that using asynchronous discussion \\n\\nforums for EFL learning increases learners’ anxiety (e.g., Bailey, Lee & Vorst, 2018). In contrast, \\n\\nother studies have reported that learners feel more confident when learning via these online forums. \\n\\nFor example, Thompson and Ku (2005) found that most Chinese students expressed more \\n\\nconfidence when sharing opinions in asynchronous online forums than in face-to-face discussions. \\n\\nSimilarly, Zhao and McDougall (2008) claimed that asynchronous online communication provides \\n\\nthose students who may have linguistic anxieties with more time for understanding and composing \\n\\nin the communication process. The reason for this variation in the research findings on VLLEs is \\n\\nthat the teaching and learning of languages is localised and context-based (Shaw, 2009). \\n\\nKumaravadivelu (2003, p. 33) argues that pedagogical strategies should be “location-specific, \\n\\nclassroom oriented and innovative strategies”. In accordance with Kumaravadivelu’s (2003) \\n\\n7 \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nproposition of a post-method pedagogy, it is not logical to assume that a pedagogy that works for \\n\\nlanguage learners in one context will work for other language learners in other contexts. This \\n\\nmakes the generalisation of research findings regarding VLLEs difficult.      \\n\\n \\n\\n  In the Saudi Arabian context, universities generally tend to use BB for providing blended \\n\\nlearning courses. However, studies conducted in the field of EFL learning for examining and \\n\\ncomparing both synchronous and asynchronous aspects of BB are limited in number. This \\n\\nindicates that the use of BB for learning EFL at Saudi universities requires more investigations. \\n\\nOne study that does examine BB learning is the work of Fageeh and Mekheimer (2013) who found \\n\\nthat students have positive attitudes towards asynchronous discussion forums; however, they feel \\n\\nmore comfortable in conventional face-to-face communication than in asynchronous discussions. \\n\\nAnother study by Pusuluri, Mahasneh & Alsayer (2017) focused on the use of BB by EFL learners \\n\\nat Al Jouf University, which is located in Saudi Arabia. Their study revealed that learners \\n\\nappreciate the fact that BB widens the scope of their learning experience. However, many learners \\n\\nwere neutral about their preference for BB learning over face-to-face learning. Also, many learners \\n\\nwere neutral about BB being considered as an interesting learning environment. Pusuluri et al. \\n\\n(2017) associated this neutrality with the learners’ insufficient awareness of the benefits of BB. \\n\\nAnother study by Ali (2017) has highlighted the positive attitudes of EFL learners towards using \\n\\nBB and related their attitudes to their high motivation levels. A recent study by Al-Mubireek \\n\\n(2019) compared students’ use of two different platforms, including BB and Oxford IQ. His study \\n\\nfound that students generally revealed positive attitudes towards learning via online platforms. \\n\\nHowever, the students in Al-Mubireek’s study were only required to participate in online learning \\n\\nfor two hours per week. A study by Anas (2020) at Bisha University confirms that Saudi students \\n\\nvalue blended learning and appreciate the interactivity of online tools, such as discussion forums \\n\\nand collaborative activities.    \\n\\n \\n\\n  It should be noted that comparing synchronous and asynchronous aspects of BB in the \\n\\nSaudi context were beyond the scope of the previous studies.  Also, all of these studies used online \\n\\nlearning as a complementary learning mode to in-class learning (i.e., blended learning). In such \\n\\ncircumstances, students spent a few hours a week engaging in online learning in order to vary their \\n\\nlearning resources and experiences. Thus, this variation that characterises blended courses may \\n\\nhave led to the students’ more positive views towards online learning.  \\n\\n \\n\\nThe case of blended learning differs from the recent case of shifting all education online \\n\\ndue to the spread of COVID-19 across the globe. The world was simply not ready for these unusual \\n\\ncircumstances. As a result, students and instructors have found themselves without any options or \\n\\nalternatives to online learning. Like what happened in many parts of the world, the quarantine in \\n\\nSaudi Arabia was announced suddenly in early March without allowing for any time to make \\n\\npreparations, but the Saudi Ministry of Education was very careful to keep all schools and \\n\\nuniversities on track with their educational plans. This was obvious in their regular instructions on \\n\\nonline teaching and assessment. Nevertheless, significant challenges have accompanied this \\n\\neducational shift. Many courses were not designed for online learning, and many students were \\n\\nnot used to online lecturing and testing. Consequently, concerns were raised by educationalists \\n\\nregarding these sudden changes (Alkhazim, 2020). This was not the case in Saudi Arabia alone. \\n\\nEducators in many other countries that have shifted exclusively to online education have raised \\n\\n8 \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nconcerns about the validity and effectiveness of this type of education (e.g., Ross, 2020). Thus, \\n\\nunderstanding the distinctive learning experiences of language learners during this exceptional \\n\\ntime could be an important step towards facilitating online learning, teaching and assessment \\n\\nparticularly in the case of catastrophes.    \\n\\n   \\n\\nTheoretical Framework \\n\\nDrawing a full repertoire of learners’ experiences with online learning means that learners’ \\n\\nevaluations of their own learning must be considered, and these evaluations should not be limited \\n\\nto their perspectives on the particular design features of the platforms. In order to evaluate the \\n\\nlearning that occurs in VLLEs, the meaning of learning needs to be transparent. The interpretation \\n\\nof learning in this study is informed by Sfard’s (1998) learning metaphors. Sfard identifies two \\n\\nmetaphors of learning: the acquisition metaphor and the participation metaphor. The acquisition \\n\\nmetaphor construes learning as a social process for expanding linguistic knowledge. This notion \\n\\nof learning relies on the Vygotskian theory of social interaction (Vygotsky, 1978). The second \\n\\nview of learning is based on Lavar and Wenger’s (1991) interpretation of learning as participation \\n\\nand engagement in a collaborative process. Sfard (1998) insisted on focusing on these two \\n\\nmetaphors in order to obtain a full understanding of what learning is. Ultimately, acquisition and \\n\\nparticipation together can lead to learning transfer. Transfer involves the application of the \\n\\nacquired knowledge and skills in real-life situations (Haskell, 2001). Billing (2007) identifies self-\\n\\nmonitoring and collaboration as the required conditions for facilitating learning transfer. In line \\n\\nwith these views, this study adapts Sfard’s (1998) two metaphors of learning in order to understand \\n\\nstudents’ perceptions towards learning via BB. The next section discusses the methodology used \\n\\nin this study.    \\n\\n \\n\\nMethodology \\n\\nDesign \\n\\nSince the purpose of this study was to understand the perceptions of university students towards \\n\\nVLLEs during an exceptional time (i.e., the COVID-19 quarantine period), the case study design \\n\\nmatched this purpose. Case studies can clarify the complexities found with respect to themes in \\n\\nthe field of applied linguistics (Duff, 2008), but they are not meant for the generalisation of \\n\\nfindings; case studies in applied linguistics are meant for examining societal, educational and \\n\\nlinguistic issues that affect language while taking context into consideration (Duff, 2008). \\n\\nEducational policies and teaching practices are usually shaped by the findings of case studies \\n\\n(Duff, 2008). What was expected from the findings of this case study was identifying the merits \\n\\nand challenges of VLLEs in order to help educational authorities and instructors in higher \\n\\neducation to rethink VLLE policies and practices to save education in a time of an emergency. \\n\\n \\n\\nContext of this Study \\n\\nThis study took place at Taif University (TU), located in the western part of Saudi Arabia. Upon \\n\\nthe announcement of the quarantine early March 2020, TU made every effort to provide both \\n\\ninstructors and students with support and facilities to make their online journey fruitful. The \\n\\nuniversity announced the availability of data SIM cards and laptops for students who might need \\n\\nthem. Also, there was a WhatsApp service provided by TU to answer urgent technical issues faced \\n\\nby teaching staff and students. Tutorial videos were posted for teaching staff on how to use BB \\n\\neffectively (including information on preparing BB lectures, administering exams and using \\n\\n9 \\n \\n\\n \\n\\ndifferent assessment tools). These tutorials were published and made public over social media. \\n\\nSimilarly, via TU official Twitter account and emails, students received some videos and \\n\\ninstructions on how to use BB for uploading assignments, attending online lectures and taking \\n\\nexams. Around this time, the Saudi Ministry of Education sent a letter to all universities stressing \\n\\nthe need for varying the use of assessment tools. The next section provides more details on the \\n\\nparticipants and courses taught to them. \\n\\n \\n\\nBackground of the Course and Participants  \\n\\nThere were 25 female bachelor of arts (BA) students in the designated English Morphology course. \\n\\nThe instructor (the author) taught this group of students in a previous semester, and the majority \\n\\nof them were considered to be highly motivated and enthusiastic. The English Morphology course \\n\\nrequired students to master three core types of learning outcomes: knowledge (understanding main \\n\\nmorphological concepts of English language), thinking skills (demonstrating higher-order thinking \\n\\nskills such as analysis, synthesis and evaluation) and competency skills (working on collaborative \\n\\ntasks and using technology effectively for learning English morphology). The students received a \\n\\nBB readiness survey at the beginning of their online experience early in March of 2020. The survey \\n\\nwas adapted from Online Readiness Assessment by Vicki Williams and The Pennsylvania State \\n\\nUniversity, and it is designed for assessing students’ readiness for studying online. The reason for \\n\\nusing this questionnaire in this study was because the instructor was not sure about her students’ \\n\\nreadiness for moving online. The survey is available at this link:    \\n\\nhttps://pennstate.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_7QCNUPsyH9f012B?s=246aa3a5c4b64bb386543ea\\n\\nb834f8e75 \\n\\n \\n\\n     Table1. gives the background information of the students’ readiness level for studying online. \\n\\n \\n\\nTable 1.

Adapted from Williams and Pennsylvania State University  \\n\\n \\n\\nAccording to Table one, the students’ computer skills varied. For instance, more than half of the \\n\\nstudents either disagreed or agreed to some extent that they were comfortable with their search and \\n\\ndownloading skills, compared to 44% who expressed that they felt comfortable with these skills. \\n\\nTable two reveals the perceived availability of online learning support and facilities. \\n\\n \\n\\nTable 2.

Adapted from Williams and Pennsylvania State University  \\n\\nAccording to Table two, 96% students knew someone who could help them with technical \\n\\nproblems. This might suggest that they did not have any critical unresolved issues during their \\n\\nonline studies. On the other hand, 48% of these students did not have headphones, which could \\n\\nhave adversely affected their study. This will be reviewed further in the results. \\n\\n \\n\\nInstruments and Data Analysis \\n\\nAs seen in the introduction, most studies on learners’ attitudes towards VLLEs have employed \\n\\nquestionnaires, and these have sometimes been combined with interviews. This study approached \\n\\n11 \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nlearners’ attitudes as reflected in their learning logs, which were designed to evaluate their learning \\n\\njourney. Logs can provide students with more space for reflecting on their learning (Morphy, \\n\\n2008). Students were given guided questions to facilitate writing in their logs (See the Appendix \\n\\nsection). Common themes were then identified and highlighted by the researcher. Fifty percent of \\n\\nthe learning logs and identified themes were checked for reliability by another researcher, and the \\n\\nlevel of agreement was almost similar (90% agreement). Their reflections in the logs were \\n\\nvalidated by their weekly attendance of online lectures and participation rates in the online forums. \\n\\nPseudonyms were used to hide the participants’ identities.         \\n\\n \\n\\nResearch Procedures \\n\\nOnline classes began on March 8, 2020 and lasted for seven weeks. After understanding \\n\\nstudents’ readiness for online learning as reported in the questionnaire, the instructor had to \\n\\nreconsider the implemented teaching practices to overcome the technical challenges identified, \\n\\nreduce stress levels and maintain students’ high levels of motivation. Here are some of the \\n\\nteaching practices that were reported to be helpful for students’ learning: \\n\\n \\n\\n● The instructor considered the students’ mental health and attempted to create a stress-free \\nlearning environment. In order to reduce the stress levels among my students, the instructor \\n\\nassured them that they would continue learning in the same effective and collaborative \\n\\nways that they had already practiced in the class. The instructor was available for them via \\n\\nBB sessions and email to address their concerns. \\n\\n● Another important mission was creating an interactive learning environment. Thus, it was \\nimportant to remind students of the course learning outcomes that we had discussed earlier \\n\\nin the semester and to relate them to higher-order thinking skills (i.e., analysis, synthesis \\n\\nand evaluation). The students were able to see that thinking skills could be easily applied \\n\\nvirtually, as will be seen later in the Results section. \\n\\n● The instructor utilised BB for creating and uploading helpful learning materials, such as \\nresearch articles that contrasted the morphological aspects of different languages and \\n\\ntutorials uploaded on YouTube. During the classes, the instructor used BB tools such as \\n\\nsharing and enlarging slides and documents, allowing students to speak and write during \\n\\nclass and asking questions to make sure that they were following what was happening in \\n\\nthe class.     \\n\\n● Realising that the students had not had an earlier experience with online lecturing in \\nconjunction with their reported fears about taking online exams, the instructor had to \\n\\nrethink the assessment tools. The new assessment plan included forums, online \\n\\nsynchronous discussions, learning logs, quizzes, extra-curricular activities, midterm exams \\n\\nand final exams.  In order to familiarise the students with online exams and reduce their \\n\\nstress levels, the instructor gave them mock exams before their midterm and final exams. \\n\\n \\n\\nResults and Discussion  \\n\\nGenerally speaking, this study has revealed that students prefer learning via asynchronous tools to \\n\\nsynchronous tools, a finding that differs from other studies on VLEs (e.g., Chen et al., 2020; Guo, \\n\\n2013). When comparing BB learning with traditional in-class learning, the students preferred in-\\n\\nclass learning, which is in line with the findings by Fageeh and Mekheimer (2013). Also, this study \\n\\nhas shown that students’ high levels of motivation do not necessarily imply that they have positive \\n\\n12 \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nattitudes towards VLLEs. The instructor taught this same group of students in a previous academic \\n\\nsemester, and the majority of them were perceived to be highly motivated; however, they revealed \\n\\na strong preference for in-class learning over online learning for reasons that will be discussed \\n\\nbelow. Interestingly, this finding is different from Ali’s (2017) on the correlation between high \\n\\nmotivation levels and positive attitudes towards VLLEs. However, it could be said that the \\n\\nlearners’ high motivation levels towards learning have led to their realisation of the importance of \\n\\ncompleting their learning experience successfully even though they may prefer traditional in-class \\n\\nlearning to the use of VLLEs. The following sub-sections discuss the strengths and weaknesses of \\n\\nVLLEs as identified by these students in their learning logs. It should be noted here that the \\n\\nstudents’ mother tongue is Arabic, and the logs were written in English. This explains why some \\n\\nquotations might include a few structural errors. Following the analyses and discussions of the \\n\\nlearning logs, data from the students’ participation in the BB forums will be considered to validate \\n\\nthe study findings.    \\n\\n \\n\\nBarriers to Online Learning \\n\\nLack of Required Information Technology (IT) Skills and Facilities \\n\\nAs reported by the learners in the BB readiness survey, there were some barriers to online learning. \\n\\nFirst, 48% of the learners did not have headphones during the first weeks of using BB, and this \\n\\naffected their communication with their instructor and peers, more particularly in the synchronous \\n\\nsessions. The only way for these students to communicate was through writing in the chat box \\n\\ninstead of oral participation. Facing technical problems has been a common issue (Rudd & Rudd, \\n\\n2014).  Furthermore, in order to help those students who reported in the BB readiness survey that \\n\\nthey were not confident with downloading files (28%) or had limited IT skills (28%), the instructor \\n\\nsent all of the students all of the required reading materials as PDF files; the instructor then \\n\\nexplained to them how to download and save these files and use some PDF features such as editing \\n\\nand adding notes. In order to avoid technical problems, the instructor directed the students to the \\n\\nWhatsApp number for the TU Technical Division, who was in charge of resolving the students’ \\n\\nonline issues. Therefore, the job of an instructor was not limited to online teaching. It should be \\n\\nnoted that there were some issues out of the hands of authorities, such as the slow speeds of the \\n\\ninternet, and this was more of a global issue. However, the instructor recorded the classes so the \\n\\nstudents could access them whenever the internet started working properly. \\n\\n \\n\\n  Regarding the issue of internet speed and the lack of headphones, one student said, “My \\n\\nexperience with virtual classes mainly depends on internet connection, but overall it is good...I \\n\\nhate to type my answer because I am kind of slow when it comes to using a keyboard.”  \\n\\n \\n\\n     In a similar vein, Lina wrote, “Many students face problems with the internet in answering \\n\\nexams or attending lectures, but for submitting assignments it is much easier. What I like about \\n\\nBB is that the sessions are recorded and we go back to them whenever we need.” \\n\\n \\n\\nDistractions at Home \\n\\nIn their learning logs, some students reported that studying at home was not working well for them. \\n\\nThis was due to distractions at home. For example, Manal wrote “I think BB does not help us to \\n\\nachieve learning outcomes because sometimes I have problem with the internet connection, or I \\n\\n13 \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nhave some work to do at my home”. Hind wrote: “I prefer traditional classes. Home is distractive. \\n\\nMy experience with online classes mainly depends on internet speed, but overall it is good.” \\n\\n \\n\\nAnother student explained why home is not a convenient place for studying online, stating, \\n\\n“my little sisters are always noisy, so I keep the mic off all the time and use the chat box to \\n\\nparticipate.”  \\n\\n \\n\\nLack of Physical Interaction \\n\\nAll these students were not used to taking lectures online. The use of BB at TU for online lecturing \\n\\nwas limited to a few courses for evaluation purposes. The majority of the students reported that \\n\\nthey preferred in-class learning to BB learning since the latter lacks physical interaction. In-class \\n\\nphysical interaction is highly valued by students as appeared in other studies (e.g., Fageeh & \\n\\nMekheimer, 2013; Vonderwell, 2003).   \\n\\n \\n\\n“I prefer face to face communication it is more interesting and comfortable for me”  \\n\\n  (Ameera/ learning log) \\n\\n \\n\\n“Finally, I am not really satisfied with learning via blackboard. I think learning in \\n\\ntraditional classes is easier and better for my learning and understanding. Overall, I still \\n\\nhaving wonderful time learning and studying morphology.” (Reema/ learning log) \\n\\n \\n\\n“I prefer traditional classes to the online ones. going to uni makes me more productive and \\n\\nI took studying seriously which is something missing in the online classes.” (Lina/ learning \\n\\nlog) “Finally, learning via Blackboard or online classes for me wasn't a good choice. \\n\\nBecause in traditional classes sitting on a chair next to a classmate listening and interacting \\n\\nwith our teacher is a way much better than being alone holding my phone and distracted \\n\\nbetween the book or taking notes, not to mention the slow internet connection or mic \\n\\nproblems.”  \\n\\n(Joory/ learning logs) \\n\\n \\n\\nNot an Appropriate Venue for Taking Exams \\n\\nBB was found to be especially stressful for a number of students during exam periods. \\n\\n \\n\\n“I always become anxious during online exams and can't focus on the questions because  \\n\\nof the short time given.” (Sana/ learning log). \\n\\n \\n\\nThis finding confirms the results reported by Bailey et al. (2018), who found that anxiety levels \\n\\nincrease in online learning environments. \\n\\n \\n\\nMerits of Online Learning \\n\\nA Preferred Learning Mode for Shy Learners \\n\\nDespite the challenges that the students reported, some advantages of learning online were also \\n\\nidentified by the students. For instance, online learning provided an opportunity for shy students \\n\\nto more easily express their opinions. This was very obvious in the discussion forums. After \\n\\ndiscussing some topics, the instructor set up a forum for students to share their views and related \\n\\n14 \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nevidence in order to facilitate engagement in active learning. Interestingly, it was found that the \\n\\nforums were helpful for shy learners who used to hesitate when participating in class. Heba, a shy \\n\\nlearner, wrote “I think learning in an actual class is better but via technology we could ask \\n\\nquestions comfortably and we can go back to the recorded classes whenever we want, so there is \\n\\na lot of advantages and disadvantages in both ways” \\n\\n \\n\\nLaila, who was another shy student, said the following when comparing traditional classes \\n\\nwith virtual classes: “Each one of them has its own advantages and disadvantages, yet virtual \\n\\nclasses are the best for me because I feel more comfortable while asking questions and \\n\\nparticipating.” \\n\\nThese findings are in line with those reported by Thompson and Ku (2005) and Zhao and \\n\\nMcDougall (2008) who claim that anxiety is actually reduced in asynchronous online discussions. \\n\\n \\n\\nBuilding an Interactive Learning Environment \\n\\nSome students appreciated working on collaborative tasks on BB: \\n\\n \\n\\n“I realized the importance of Morphology when I tried to understand the word itself, and \\n\\nhow it was built by analysing the affixes of the word. I feel more engaged when I make \\n\\ndiscussions with my classmates. It really helped me to understand each point and to \\n\\nreinforce my understanding. Also clarifying some points to my classmates helped a lot.” \\n\\n(Joory/ learning logs) \\n\\n \\n\\nAchieving Learning Outcomes (to Some Extent) \\n\\nSome students thought that despite the challenges of online learning, it had still helped them to \\n\\nreach the course learning outcomes. \\n\\n“I honestly didn’t like it at all due to the problems I have faced such as internet  \\n\\nconnection problems, but overall I can't say it didn’t help me in achieving the course \\n\\noutcomes, of course \\n\\n it did.” (Renad) \\n\\n \\n\\nIn their reflections, some students were very specific about how this course, which was partly \\n\\nconducted over BB, improved their learning. They talked about the transfer of some critical \\n\\nthinking skills (e.g., analysis and evaluation) to other courses, including translation courses. \\n\\n \\n\\n“I found word formation is the most helpful topic for understanding the relationship \\n\\nbetween morphology and other courses. It helped me a lot in translation because I came \\n\\nacross some new words that I didn’t know their meaning, but I could guess the meaning \\n\\nfrom their word formation. However, the most challenging point was when we divided \\n\\nwords from other languages into morphemes and wrote the morphological rules that were \\n\\nused. It was difficult at the beginning because I didn't even know the meaning of these \\n\\nwords, but we did a lot of exercises until the process became easy for me. For thinking \\n\\nskills, I think I kind of master ‘noticing’ and ‘application’ skills. For example, in \\n\\nidentifying the processes in words of other languages, I used to notice the changes and the \\n\\nprocesses used and also applying the same  processes to other words, even if they were not \\n\\n15 \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nEnglish words.” (Hajar/ learning log) Salwa agrees with Hajar on how this course helped \\n\\nher in her translation course, stating,  \\n\\n \\n\\n“Mostly all the information we took in this course are related to the other courses. For example, \\n\\nlearning about affixes helped to know the meaning of words that I didn't met before. This strategy \\n\\nis important in translation courses, since we're meeting new terms every class.”Reham mentioned \\n\\nadditional evidence of transfer:  \\n\\n \\n\\n“This course is full of useful information that I use in all the courses and in my language \\n\\nacquisition in general. For example, the study of the word formation processes helped me \\n\\nin the Language Acquisition course specially in understanding the stages that children go \\n\\nthrough when acquiring the language. It helped me understand which of the morphological \\n\\nmorphemes children develop first. Since the Language Acquisition course is all about the \\n\\nstructure of  language and how it's acquired, this morphology course eased things for me. \\n\\nI think all the  information I learned in this course will absolutely benefit me in the future \\n\\nbecause I'm already  analyzing any word my eye falls on so I think will always carry these \\n\\ninformation and keep developing them since I now like morphology I'll keep progressing.” \\n\\n \\n\\nThis transfer of skills was a result of the intensive collaborative online tasks that the students were \\n\\nengaged in. This suggests that collaborative learning, although not occurring in class, can lead to \\n\\neffective learning transfer (Billing, 2007; Haskell, 2001). Also, it shows that despite the \\n\\ndisadvantages of online learning, learning can occur with the facilitation of instructors who vary \\n\\nthe learning resources and assessment tools. The transfer of knowledge and skills to other courses \\n\\nindicates that the students have achieved the two learning outcomes of increased knowledge and \\n\\nimproved skills mentioned earlier in the Methodology. Further evidence in support of this is the \\n\\nfact that students demonstrated the abilities to evaluate their learning experiences and explain how \\n\\nthe identified merits and barriers of BB had affected their learning. \\n\\n \\n\\n  In order to further validate that the course outcomes were achieved, this study considered \\n\\nthe number of students’ posts in the BB forums. There were four forums in total, and Tables 3 and \\n\\n4 show the extracted engagement indicators. \\n\\n \\n\\nTable 3.

Samples of students’ engagement indicators in BB forums \\n\\nBB forums Number of \\n\\nparticipants \\n\\nTotal number of \\n\\nposts \\n\\nThe number of \\n\\ninitiated posts \\n\\nThe number of \\n\\nreplies \\n\\nForum 2 24 102 24 78 \\n\\n16 \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nForum 4 19 84 17 67 \\n\\n \\n\\nIn Forum two, almost all of the students participated in the discussion. There were 24 initiated \\n\\nposts which referred to newly posted information, extended discussions on a related topic and \\n\\nquestions asked. The 24 initiated posts received 78 replies. The number of participants in Forum \\n\\nfour was lower than the others (19 students), which means that six students did not take part in this \\n\\nforum. However, this did not affect the students’ active engagement in the discussions. There were \\n\\n17 initiated posts, which is a relatively high number when compared to the number of participants. \\n\\nThe 17 initiated posts received 67 replies. The students’ participation in the forums indicates that \\n\\nthe majority of the students have achieved the competency skills, a learning outcome which \\n\\nrequired students to collaborate with others successfully and use technology effectively.  \\n\\n \\n\\nThe analyses of the students’ learning logs where they identified some evidence of learning \\n\\ntransfer and participation rates in the BB forums revealed how learning can be interpreted and \\n\\nassessed in accordance with Sfard’s (1998) definition of learning as a process of acquisition and \\n\\nparticipation. What seems to facilitate transfer of learning is participation because it allows \\n\\nlearners to practise what they had learned. It could be said that transfer is the ultimate outcome of \\n\\nacquisition and participation. Therefore, Sfard’s (1998) two metaphors (i.e., the acquisition \\n\\nmetaphor and the participation metaphor) allow language educators and instructors to understand \\n\\nwhat language learning refers to and how it can be assessed. \\n\\n \\n\\nTo sum up, this study highlights the benefits and challenges that VLLEs bring for students. \\n\\nThis study has shown that students prefer learning via asynchronous tools to learning via \\n\\nsynchronous tools, a finding that confirms Fageeh and Mekheimer’s (2013) study and contradicts \\n\\nother studies on VLEs (e.g., Chen et al., 2020; Guo, 2013). Due to challenges experienced by \\n\\nstudents in this study, such as the lack of physical interaction and having technical problems, it is \\n\\nconcluded that online learning cannot fully replace traditional in-class teaching, a point confirmed \\n\\nin other studies (e.g., Fageeh & Mekheimer, 2013; Vonderwell, 2003). By understanding students’ \\n\\nexperiences with BB learning, institutions can produce a back-up plan for replacing traditional \\n\\nteaching with VLEs in a time of an emergency. Institutions are now required to increase the \\n\\nnumber of online teaching development courses provided for their instructors, so instructors should \\n\\nalways be on standby in case education is shifted online for any reason, as in the case of the \\n\\nCOVID-19 quarantine period. Instructors should open a discussion channel with their students in \\n\\norder to become aware of their needs and understand barriers to online learning. Such open \\n\\ndiscussions will lead to constructive innovation in teaching practices. Also, as part of their \\n\\ncommitment to society, local organisations should contribute to the advancement of education by \\n\\nproviding educational institutions and their students with technical support (e.g., laptops, iPads or \\n\\nheadphones) to reduce the stress of learning in a time of unease. Finally, students should be aware \\n\\nof their responsibility as learners who must spare no efforts when engaging in VLLEs in order to \\n\\nachieve their learning outcomes. The following figure, proposed by the author, identifies all of the \\n\\nparties involved in the success of university students’ learning in VLEs.  \\n\\n \\n\\n17 \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nFigure 1. Advancing VLLEs in a time of unease \\n\\nFigure one shows that successful virtual learning experience requires the active collaboration of \\n\\nall involved parties: local organizations that are known for their contribution to the community \\n\\nservice activities and who can support learners with their educational needs, the educational \\n\\ninstitutions who are responsible for providing students with all necessary needs of IT services \\n\\nand knowledge resources, the students who are aware of their needs and who can lead their \\n\\nlearning journeys and the instructors who can facilitate learning and can guide their students \\n\\ntowards effective learning.  \\n\\n \\n\\nConclusions and Recommendations \\n\\nThis study represents a thin slice of the world’s concerns associated with the educational shift to \\n\\nonline learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. Issues regarding students’ readiness for this mode \\n\\nof education have been of concern in many countries. The case study reported in this article \\n\\ninvestigated the perceptions of Saudi university students towards learning via BB. The students’ \\n\\nlearning logs that evaluated their own learning experiences with asynchronous and synchronous \\n\\ntools formed the main source for the study data. The study revealed that the students were aware \\n\\nof the benefits and challenges associated with VLLEs, and that they favoured traditional in-class \\n\\nlearning to VLLEs. When comparing asynchronous and synchronous environments, students \\n\\npreferred the asynchronous environment due to its flexibility. Unlike some existing studies, this \\n\\nstudy explains that motivated students can become more anxious students in VLLEs, and that many \\n\\nstudents prefer physical interaction. The fact that some of the findings reported in this study were \\n\\nnot in line with findings of studies conducted in similar contexts highlights the need for carrying \\n\\nout further investigations of university students’ perceptions and experiences with VLLEs. Such \\n\\ninvestigations will inform the plans of institutions when education shifts fully online in critical \\n\\nsituations. Also, these investigations will contribute to the development of teaching practices and \\n\\nthe design of professional development courses aimed at higher education instructors faced with \\n\\nunusual circumstances.        \\n\\n       \\n\\n18 \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nAcknowledgements \\n\\nThe author would like to thank all the participants for their endless cooperation during the \\n\\nconduction of this study. \\n\\n \\n\\nDeclaration of conflicting interests \\n\\nThe author has no conflicts of interest to declare.  \\n\\n \\n\\nAbout the Author:  \\n\\nHaifa A.
