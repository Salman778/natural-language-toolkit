      "Introduction \n",
      "The early focus of Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL) was on using the computer as \n",
      "a learning tool, and this was due to the limited access to the internet in the 1980s and 1990s. Later, \n",
      "the  availability  of  the  internet  facilitated  the  construction  of  Virtual  Learning  Environments \n",
      "(VLEs) that have been developed to facilitate interaction and collaboration (Schwienhorst, 2002). \n",
      "VLEs  have  been  incorporated  into  many  higher  education  institutions.  Regarding  the  field  of \n",
      "learning English as a Foreign Language (EFL), there has been a clear preference for combining \n",
      "Virtual  Language  Learning  Environments  (VLLEs)  and  flipped  learning  approaches  over \n",
      "traditional in-class learning. VLLEs appear in various forms, such as platforms, games and social \n",
      "networks (Mroz, 2014). This preference for utilising VLLEs is due to a number of reasons. First, \n",
      "many EFL studies  have  revealed the positive impact  that  VLLEs bring to  language learners in \n",
      "terms  of  learning  development  despite  the  existing  challenges  (e.g.,  training,  cost  and  security \n",
      "issues) (Mroz, 2014). What facilitates the development of the learners’ language skills is the fact \n",
      "that VLLEs provide a space for collaborative learning (Mroz, 2014). Collaborative learning is a \n",
      "“social process of knowledge building” (Miyake & Kirschner, 2014, p. 420). This process requires \n",
      "that  learners  work  together  when  solving  problems  or  completing  tasks.  Additionally,  many \n",
      "linguists believe that VLLEs can create a learning environment that resembles the culture of the \n",
      "target language, and consequently, this can further facilitate language learning (Mroz, 2014). Also, \n",
      "the  incorporation  of  VLEs,  which  entails  the  use  of  technology,  meets  “the  needs  of  digital \n",
      "learners”  (Gamble,  2018,  p.    23).    VLLEs  is  not  obstacle-free.  The  purpose  of  this  study  is  to \n",
      "investigate  the  perceptions  of  Saudi  university  students  towards  online  learning  during  the \n",
      "COVID-19  quarantine  period.  This  work  presents  one  of  so  many  stories  around  the  world \n",

      "COVID-19 will persist for months and will continue to affect the next academic semester. Many \n",
      "universities around the world have made their decisions to continue with online lectures for the \n",

      "to get a sense of how learners experience online learning in order to improve the delivery of online \n",
      "courses and advance teaching innovation in their contexts. Also, learners’ experiences with VLLEs \n",
      "can  be  an  effective  source  for  informing  the  design  and  content  of  professional  development \n",
